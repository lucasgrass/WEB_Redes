# About


## Home 

It`s a menu to navigate between the others 3 screens of the project

## Gôndola_Entry

A screen that we type the quantity of any product in the list, to move from stock to gôndola. To move you have to press the button "Mover para a Gondula".

## Gôndola_Exit

A screen that works like a supermarket cashier but a little bit different. You type the quantity of any product in the list, like the Gôndola_Entry, but the objective is to remove from gôndula.

## Gôndola_Consult

The last screen it`s just to literally consult the quantity of products in gôndola.
